        <p>‍The product demo phase is one of the most critical parts of the sales process. If you allow us a cheap
            comparison, until this time, the relationship with the prospect was like chatting with a partner before a
            blind-date. You gave your sales pitch, described your company, tried to align expectations, and everything
            seemed great on paper. But now it’s time to meet. Only while the prospect meets with your software, they can
            understand if it’s a match for them. And you don’t want to mess that up - that’s what will make or break the
            deal.</p>

        <p>To give yourself the best chance of success, make sure to plan, create, and prepare the demo script well
            before the pitch. </p>

        <p>What is a sales demo script?</p>
        <p>A demo script is the written portion of your demo that outlines the narrative you’ll use when showcasing your
            visuals. Your sales demo script offers a prompt for critical messages, visuals, and benefits you want to
            cover
            with your clients during a demo.</p>

        <p>Researching before writing a demo script</p>
        <p>Before writing your demo script, you already had several interactions with your prospect. You used your
            initial
            discovery call to qualify your potential customer and learn more about their pain points.</p>

        <p>Supplement the knowledge you gained during this call with additional research into the industry. In other
            words:
            Use everything you already know about the client to personalize your script.</p>

        <p>How to structure your sales demo script step-by-step
            You should prepare to think on your feet during a demo, but using a predetermined structure will improve the
            flow of your demonstration and make you appear confident and well-prepared.</p>

        <p>Introduce yourself and the main message
            The goal of the introduction is to build rapport and credibility with your prospect.</p>

        <p>Start by introducing yourself and why you are qualified to present your product to the prospects. If you’ve
            worked with businesses similar to the prospect’s company, tell them up front so they know you understand
            their
            industry and pain points.</p>

        <p>Then, reiterate your main message. Think of the one thing you want clients to remember after you’ve left. You
            may want to repeat this message a few times and close with a reiteration at the end.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, the main difficulty is to make sure your demos are consistent for all your prospects
            and
            across your sales reps.</p>

            product
            presentation are perfect for each customer’s use-case. The ultimate goal is to master your demos consistency
            and
            quality in order to scale.</p>
